# Deploying a Static Website Using S3 Bucket

 In this project, I hosted a static website using an AWS S3 bucket. This method eliminates the need to manage a server, allowing you to focus on your website's content and design. I streamline the setup and deployment process by making use of Github actions for the CI/CD pipeline. This approach is ideal for maintaining efficiency and adhering to industry standards.
